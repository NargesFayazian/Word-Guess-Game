<h4>How to Play:</h4>

Press any Alpha key (A-Z, a-z) to start the game. Nonalpha keys are ignored. The theme of the game is 'World Countries'. The game will randomly select a world country from its internal list. It will then display a blank word using underscores to represent the letters in the word. 
If a correct letter is guessed, the game will reveal the letter in its correct location. If an incorrect letter is selected, then it will add the letter to a list of incorrectly guessed letters and decrement the remaining guesses count.
If the user guesses the correct country name before remaining guesses equal zero, then the game increments the number of wins and restarts the game by selecting a new random country name and resetting the game parameters.
If the user does not guess the correct country name within the allocated number of guesses, then the game resets.
