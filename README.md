<h4>How to Play:</h4>

<p>Press any Alpha key (A-Z, a-z) to start the game. Nonalpha keys are ignored. The theme of the game is 'World Countries'. The game will randomly select a world country from its internal list. It will then display a blank word using underscores to represent the letters in the word. </br>
If a correct letter is guessed, the game will reveal the letter in its correct location. If an incorrect letter is selected, then it will add the letter to a list of incorrectly guessed letters and decrement the remaining guesses count.</br>
If the user guesses the correct country name before remaining guesses equal zero, then the game increments the number of wins and restarts the game by selecting a new random country name and resetting the game parameters.</br>
If the user does not guess the correct country name within the allocated number of guesses, then the game resets.</p>
